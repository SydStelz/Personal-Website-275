            <h2>The Different Mediums Used</h2>
            <p>Art is a very broad subject, and there are many different types of mediums that you can use to create art. When you think of art mediums, you might automatically think of things like paints and pencils, but those aren't the only types. Paints and pencils are examples of mediums for 2D art, but there are also mediums for 3D art. Some 3D mediums are clay, wire, and fashion design. Another type of art is photography. Photography could be digital, but can even include things such as graphic design and animation.</p>
            <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>Even though I enjoy making art, I have not used many of these mediums before. I am <strong>not</strong> claiming to be an expert, and I might not include every art medium there is out there. I just want to educate people on the variety of art mediums there are and hopefully inspire people to make some type of art.  </p>
