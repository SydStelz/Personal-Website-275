            <h2>My Top 5 Favorite Art Mediums</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Alcohol Markers</li>
                <li>Colored Pencils</li>
                <li>Graphite Pencils</li>
                <li>Acrylic Paint</li>
                <li>Watercolors</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>1.</strong> Alcohol Markers</h3>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>By far, alcohol markers are my favorite medium to use to create art with. These markers are different from your typical
            Crayola markers, though. Crayola markers are water based, which is why they tend to ruin the paper if you layer them to much.
            Alcohol markers are alcohol-based, and are made for layering. Alcohol markers are great for blending, and come in hundreds of
            colors. I like using them because they are easy to layer and cover great areas of the paper.</p>
            <h3><strong>2.</strong> Colored Pencils</h3>
            <figure>

            <figcaption>Prismacolor Brand Colored Pencils</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>My second favorite art medium is colored pencils. Once again, the colored pencils I use are different from the Crayola ones.
            Artist based colored pencils are highly pigmented and are waxy, allowing you to blend the colors easily.You can change the pressure
            to make lighter and darker shades from one pencil. These also come in a variety of colors and are easy to layer and create new colors.
            Once sharpened, color pencils are great for making small details. You can even erase them if you draw light enough which is great if
            you make a mistake.</p>
            <h3><strong>3.</strong> Graphite Pencils</h3>
            <figure>
            <img src="images/graphitepencils.png" alt="Picture of Graphite Pencils">
            <figcaption>Types of Graphite Pencils</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Even though I don't use them too often, I enjoy making art with graphite pencils. When you think of pencils, you probably think
            of the standard hb pencils that you use in school, but there are other types of pencils out there. One example is a 2B pencil. The B
            at the end signifies that it's a soft graphite, and it's easier to break the lead. If the label ends in H, that means that the lead is
            hard, and harder to break. B pencils are great for coloring in large areas, while H are great for small details. In the numbering system.
            the larger the number, the darker the graphite. They are quite messy, though.</p>
            <h3><strong>4.</strong> Acrylic Paint</h3>
            <figure>
            <img src="images/acrylicpaint.png" alt="Picture of Acrylic Paint">
            <figcaption>Tubes of Acrylic Paint</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Even though I tend to get sick of acrylic paintings, I still love to use the medium. Acrylic paint is special, because once it dries,
            it turns into a plastic-like material. This makes it shiny and movable even once it's done drying. Acrylic paints are easily blendable,
            and you can make any color with just the three primary colors, black, and white. They are quick-drying, though, so you have to work quickly.
            I tend to get annoyed with painting after a while. I get sick of mixing colors everytime and having to do multiple layers of a color.</p>
            <h3><strong>5.</strong> Watercolors</h3>
            <figure>
            <img src="images/watercolors.png" alt="Picture of Watercolor Tubes">
            <figcaption>Tubes of Watercolor</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Watercolors are last on my favorites list, and this is because I don't use them as often, and because of that, I don't really know
            how to use them. Watercolors are less pigmented than paint, because they are activated with water. They come in two different types: pan
            and tube. Pan watercolors are dried and are layed out on a pan and tube watercolors are kept in tubes to be squeezed out when used. I prefer
            tube watercolors just because I feel like I can control the amount of water I'm using better. It's hard to make the same color twice because
            you need to remember how much water to mix with them.</p>
